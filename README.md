# Pac-man

This project is an implementation of the classic arcade game Pac-man. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate the game's logic, user interface, and control flow. The user interface is built using Java Swing, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Features

#### Model-View-Controller (MVC):
The game follows the MVC architectural pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The model represents the game's data and logic, the view handles the user interface components and rendering, and the controller manages user input and updates the model accordingly.
#### Java Swing UI:
The user interface is built using Java Swing, a powerful and flexible GUI toolkit. Swing components are used to create a visually appealing game interface, including the game board, pacman, ghosts, and various elements such as score displays and level indicators.
#### Game Logic:
The project implements the core gameplay mechanics of Pacman, including movement of pacman and ghosts, collision detection, scoring, level progression, and power-ups.
#### Map Generating:
The map generation algorithm implemented in this project allows for the creation of random maps of various sizes. It generates a new map each time, accommodating different numbers of rows and columns dynamically.
#### Serializable Interface: 
The usage of the Serializable interface in this project allows for the saving and loading of data in a serialized format. By implementing the Serializable interface in relevant classes, objects can be converted into a byte stream and stored in a file or transferred across a network. This provides a convenient way to persist data and retrieve it for later use.
